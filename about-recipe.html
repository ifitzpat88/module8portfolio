        <p>I picked up this Beef Chili Mac & Cheese recipe from my mom, who often made it for us when we were kids. It's simple, filling, and has been a favorite in our family for years.</p>
        <h3>Why This Recipe is Special</h3>

            <li>It combines the hearty flavors of chili with the comfort of mac and cheese</li>
            <li>Perfect for busy weeknights or large family gatherings</li>
